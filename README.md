### Notes
* The app removes duplicate entries of vehicles (vehicles that have all of the same information)
* The app sacrifices a bit of computation time when the data loads in order to create a mapping of search terms to vehicles in order to improve performance on subsequent filtering (when values are entered in the search field)
* The search functionality doesn't work on partial strings (this was a performance optimization decision)
* Some vehicles may be duplicates (very similar information with only slight differences) which I've chosen to leave in. For example, there's a 2014 Honda Civic that appears twice in the list with the only difference being they were created exactly 2 months apart (down to the second).
* Time zones are all converted to local time (using Moment.js)
